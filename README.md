# Database Design Project
Project accomplished in intro to databases with Thomas Wooten, a classmate.

# Project1 SQL file
In this file, the database is created with the ER diagram detailed in the report. It has been normalized in several ways, 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. At the end of the .sql file, there are five questions that may be interesting to upper management of the store that requested this database.
